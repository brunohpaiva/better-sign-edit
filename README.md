# Better Sign Edit

The 1.20 version of Minecraft added the ability to edit signs which have already been placed.

That's nice, but it can be quite annoying. For example: when a sign is placed on top of a chest, you can mis-click and start editing the sign instead of opening the chest.

This mod fixes that, by only letting you edit the sign when sneaking, and it also adds some other quality-of-life features.

## Features

- Only allow editing signs when sneaking
- Only save sign edits by clicking the 'Done' button, not by pressing 'Escape'

## Download
